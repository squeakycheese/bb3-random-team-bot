# bb3-random-team-bot
This is a basic Discord bot that will randomly return a Blood Bowl 3 team when a Discord user types in `/pickteam` in a server/channel it has access to.

To run the bot:
`node main.js TOKEN=<token>`

To-do list:
- Setup hosting on AWS EC2 instance
- Set up GitHub to autmatically update EC2 instance when new code is pushed
